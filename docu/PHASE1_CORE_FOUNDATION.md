# Phase 1: Core Foundation - Personal Push-to-Talk System

## Overview
Phase 1 establishes the fundamental GNA/NPU voice detection system for personal use on Dell Latitude 5450 MIL-SPEC hardware.

**Focus**: Individual user excellence, not enterprise features
**Duration**: 3 weeks
**Goal**: Ultra-responsive personal voice input system

## Core Objectives

### **Week 1: Hardware Foundation**
**HARDWARE-INTEL Agent Lead**

#### **GNA Integration**
```cpp
// Core GNA voice activity detection
class PersonalGNADetector {
    // Ultra-low power continuous monitoring
    bool detect_voice_activity(const float* audio);

    // Personal wake word recognition
    bool detect_wake_word(const AudioFeatures& features);

    // Instant NPU handoff for transcription
    void trigger_transcription();
};
```

**Key Tasks:**
- [ ] GNA device configuration for personal use
- [ ] Basic voice activity detection at <0.05W
- [ ] Personal wake word training ("Computer", "Voice", etc.)
- [ ] Audio preprocessing optimization

**Success Criteria:**
- GNA running continuously with minimal power impact
- Reliable wake word detection for personal use
- <50ms response time from voice to NPU activation

### **Week 2: NPU Integration**
**HARDWARE-INTEL + C-INTERNAL Agents**

#### **NPU Speech Recognition**
```cpp
// NPU-accelerated speech processing
class PersonalNPUProcessor {
    // Whisper model optimized for personal vocabulary
    std::string transcribe_audio(const AudioBuffer& buffer);

    // Context adaptation for user's common phrases
    void adapt_to_user_patterns(const std::vector<std::string>& history);

    // Fast model switching for different contexts
    void switch_context(VoiceContext context);
};
```

**Key Tasks:**
- [ ] OpenVINO NPU backend for Whisper models
- [ ] Personal vocabulary optimization
- [ ] Context-aware transcription (coding, writing, commands)
- [ ] Model caching for instant switching

**Success Criteria:**
- Sub-5ms NPU inference for common phrases
- 95%+ accuracy for personal speech patterns
- Seamless GNA→NPU handoff

### **Week 3: System Integration**
**C-INTERNAL + INFRASTRUCTURE Agents**

#### **System Service**
```cpp
// Lightweight personal voice service
class PersonalVoiceService {
    // Background service for individual user
    void run_personal_service();

    // Hotkey capture (Ctrl+Alt+Space)
    void setup_personal_hotkeys();

    // Direct text injection to active app
    void inject_text_to_focused_app(const std::string& text);
};
```

**Key Tasks:**
- [ ] Personal system service (user-level, not system-wide)
- [ ] Global hotkey capture for personal use
- [ ] Basic text injection to active applications
- [ ] Simple configuration for personal preferences

**Success Criteria:**
- Reliable personal voice service
- Hotkey-triggered voice input working
- Text appears in any application (browser, terminal, editor)

## Technical Architecture

### **Personal Use Focus**
```bash
Individual User System:
├── GNA: Always-on personal wake word detection
├── NPU: Fast transcription for personal vocabulary
├── Service: User-level background service
├── Hotkeys: Personal keyboard shortcuts
└── Injection: Direct text to active applications
```

### **No Enterprise Complexity**
- No fleet management
- No centralized policies
- No enterprise security frameworks
- No multi-user coordination
- Simple personal configuration

## Implementation Details

### **Phase 1.1: GNA Personal Detection (Week 1)**
```bash
Personal Voice Detection:
├── Configure GNA for single user patterns
├── Train personal wake words
├── Optimize power consumption for laptop use
├── Test in personal environment (home office)
└── Validate response time for individual use
```

### **Phase 1.2: NPU Personal Transcription (Week 2)**
```bash
Personal Speech Recognition:
├── Load Whisper models optimized for individual use
├── Personal vocabulary adaptation
├── Context switching (coding vs writing vs commands)
├── Fast inference for personal speech patterns
└── Quality validation for individual accuracy
```

### **Phase 1.3: Personal System Service (Week 3)**
```bash
Individual User Integration:
├── User-level service (no system privileges needed)
├── Personal hotkey configuration
├── Text injection to personal applications
├── Simple settings for individual preferences
└── Basic error handling and recovery
```

## Success Metrics

### **Personal Use Targets**
| Metric | Target | Personal Focus |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Response Time** | <5ms | Personal productivity |
| **Accuracy** | >95% | Individual speech patterns |
| **Power Usage** | <0.05W idle | Laptop battery life |
| **Setup Time** | <10 minutes | Personal installation |
| **Learning Curve** | <30 minutes | Individual user onboarding |

### **Quality Gates**
- [ ] **Week 1**: GNA personal wake word detection working
- [ ] **Week 2**: NPU personal transcription functional
- [ ] **Week 3**: Complete personal push-to-talk system

## Personal Configuration

### **Simple User Settings**
```json
{
  "personal_settings": {
    "wake_word": "Computer",
    "hotkey": "Ctrl+Alt+Space",
    "language": "en-US",
    "context": "coding",
    "voice_threshold": 0.7,
    "power_mode": "balanced"
  }
}
```

### **Personal Use Cases**
- **Coding**: Voice input while programming
- **Writing**: Dictation for documents and emails
- **Terminal**: Voice commands in command line
- **Web**: Form filling and search queries
- **Notes**: Quick voice note-taking

## Next Steps After Phase 1

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Personal Features (Weeks 4-6)**
- Voice commands for personal automation
- Personal vocabulary learning
- Application-specific contexts
- Voice shortcuts for common tasks

### **Phase 3: Personal Optimization (Weeks 7-9)**
- Performance tuning for individual hardware
- Personal usage pattern learning
- Advanced voice commands
- Personal voice profile optimization

**Note**: Enterprise features (fleet management, centralized policies, etc.) are stretch goals beyond core personal functionality.
